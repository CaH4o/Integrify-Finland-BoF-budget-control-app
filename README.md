## Description

This application helps manage a budget by tracking income, expenses, savings, and balance. Each data category is stored in global state and saved to localStorage for persistence.

Key features:

- Four main blocks: **Income**, **Expenses**, **Savings**, and **Balance**
- Responsive design using **Material UI** and **Flexbox**
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode) using **Material UI's** palette and context API
- State management using **Reducer** and **Context Provider**
- Written with **TypeScript** and tested with **Jest**

By building this project, I improved my skills in React, Material UI, state management, and data storage in the browser.
